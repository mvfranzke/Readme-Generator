# Module-9-Challenge (Professional README Generator)
## Description
This is the 9th assignment or challenge for our bootcamp class. In this assignment we're tasked to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file based from the user's input using the 'Inquirer Package'. The application is invoked following the command: 

```
node index.js
```

## Installation
Inquirer package must be installed by entering below in the command line:

```
npm i inquirer @8.2.4
```

## Usage
Given the command-line application that accepts user input, user will be prompted to enter the title of their project, description, installation, usage, license, how to contribute, test, github username and email. Once user enter all the information, they will receive a prompt that README file is created which display all their entries and display list table of contents with links.
